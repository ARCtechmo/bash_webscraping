This project is for my own educational and training purposes and not intended for professional use.

The purpose of this project is to build a simple webscraping tool using BASH.  
The code provided is to demonstrate the step-by-step process to build the application.
scrape.sh is the  webscraping utility. 
utf8.sh is used to demonstrate various methods to split strings and capture the character encoding from a file taken from the web.

I will update this file as the project develops.
