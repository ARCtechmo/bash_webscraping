minor issue: user input errors
I wrote the code to account for user input errors for the filename and extensions.
For instance, if the user inputs an incorrect extension the program will end or
the program will try to compensate for the error. If the user inputs an extra dot
not an extension it is not accounting for this.  For example, if the user enters
..csv or ...html, I used regexp and awk to remove the extra dots.  However, this is
not working entirely.
